**Key Success Formula:**
`Trend Identification + Rapid Execution + Authentic Content + Community Engagement + Operational Readiness = Sustainable Success`

## Phase 1: Technical Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

### Primary Data Extraction Method: Semi-Automated Screen Recording + OCR

**Why this approach:**
- Avoids TikTok's anti-bot detection systems
- Maintains compliance with terms of service
- Provides reliable, consistent data extraction
- Balances automation with manual oversight

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Screen Recording Setup**
   - iOS: Use ReplayKit or Reflector app
   - Android: MediaProjection API or Scrcpy
   - Maintain 30-60 FPS for optimal OCR accuracy

2. **OCR Processing Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Basic pipeline structure
   class CSIExtractor:
       def __init__(self):
           self.ocr_service = "google_cloud_vision"  # or amazon_textract
           self.output_format = "json"
           
       def process_recording(self, video_file):
           frames = extract_frames(video_file)
           text_data = []
           for frame in frames:
               text = self.ocr_service.extract_text(frame)
               text_data.append(parse_csi_data(text))
           return consolidate_data(text_data)
   ```

3. **Cost-Effective Tool Stack**
   - **Budget Option ($50-200/month)**: Tesseract OCR + Python + SQLite
   - **Professional ($300-1000/month)**: Google Cloud Vision + AWS + PostgreSQL
   - **Enterprise ($5000+/month)**: Custom solution with Snowflake + Tableau
