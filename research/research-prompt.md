Do you know about Tiktok Creator Search Insight?

I need a way to extract out the trending search insights and from the extracted result, I use AI to analyse what I can do to use this trend to make some profit, for example, create a saas, mobile app, services, product, courses or any other relevant thing. 

But Tiktok Creator Searh Insight only available in Tiktok mobile app, not in the web version, so I have no idea how to extract the information. It can add creator search insight to the mobile home screen, but im not sure if this will help
